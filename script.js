//Please develop a web based calculator following the backlog below. Do not spend more than 3h on this challenge. This wonâ€™t be enough time to solve the task so decide on your own how to compromise quality vs. quantity. Please use git for this task so progress can be followed easily and add a README.md so new developers know where to start. All other tools and frameworks are up to you.
